# Quiz-App-FLutter-
My first basic quiz app using Flutter framework.

> Quiz-app has a set of only 3 questions as of now, but I will soon be creating a a large collection of intriguing questions on a server    which will be fetched by the app according to the category chosen to play with.

> In this, I have only used some basic widgets like ---> 
  
  > Scaffold
  > AppBar
  > Preferred size
  > Column
  > Text
  > Container
  > Stateless &
  > Statefull
