# Quiz-App-FLutter-
My first basic quiz app was using the Flutter framework.

> Quiz-app has a set of only three questions as of now, but I will soon be creating a large collection of intriguing questions on a server that will be fetched by the app according to the category chosen to play with.

> In this, I have only used some basic widgets like ---> 
  
  -> Scaffold
  -> AppBar
  -> Preferred size
  -> Column
  -> Text
  -> Container
  -> Stateless &
  -> Statefull
